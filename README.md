<h1 align="center" id="title">Armandt Erasmus - Data Science Portfolio Projects</h1>

<p id="description">This repository serves as a digital portfolio for all of my data science projects that I have completed. Currently there is only one main folder containing machine learning based projects such as classification models. Each folder is descriptive of the type of model used and contains a general explanation of how the model works and the mathematics behind them as well as in-depth usage guides in the form of a project or simple implementation frameworks that can be used as a quick reference in the future.</p>
